<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>Harvey has indulged in many hobbies over the years: photography, coin collecting, sports card collecting, chess, and music (he plays guitar and has just started learning to play the electronic keyboard). He has also performed in several stage musicals as well as civic theater over the years and performed in several weddings, accompanying himself with guitar. Harvey attended a voice actorsâ€™ workshop over 20 years ago with Alice Whitfield in Las Vegas and the voice over bug hit. However, due to other job duties, he was unable to participate until just recently, when he was struck once again with the urge to follow this pursuit. His previous experience in teaching and giving professional presentations has helped enormously, as he is currently working on his 4th audiobook in the past 2 months. He has also begun learning to code and would like to pursue this line of training as well.
